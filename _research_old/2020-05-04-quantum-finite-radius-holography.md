We calculate quantum corrections to holographic entanglement entropy in the proposed duality between TTbar-deformed holographic 2D CFTs and gravity in AdS_3 with a finite cutoff. We first establish the dictionary between the two theories by mapping the flow equation of the deformed CFT to the bulk Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The latter reduces to an ordinary differential equation for the sphere partition function, which we solve to find the entanglement entropy for an entangling surface consisting of two antipodal points on a sphere. The entanglement entropy in the inverse central charge expansion yields the expectation value of the bulk length operator plus the entropy of length fluctuations, in accordance with the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and its generalization due to Faulkner, Lewkowycz, and Maldacena. Special attention is paid to the conformal mode problem and its resolution by a choice of contour for the gravitational path integral
